# To find an Optimum Machine Learning Model for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Sensor Data
As a part of Udacity's MLND Capstone Project

This repository describes an approach to determine Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Sensor Data.

The solution uses Python 2.7, but can also be used with python 3.x

Python packages Required to run the Notebooks: 
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Keras
* Tensorflow
* pickle
* LightGBM

## Required Files
  Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/human-activity-recognition-with-smartphones/data
  
  
## Steps

* Run the notebooks based on their numeric sequencing after downloading the dataset.
* The report includes explaination for each implementation with embeded links clicking on which will lead to the Implementation/Jupyter Notebook.

* Please note that the complete notebook is split into 7 parts for ease of access. For each of the 4 algorithms, the Basic model, the rifinement and Final optimized model, all are captured in the same notebook.
* 1. Capstone_Exploration : Includes data import and vizualizing the dataset.
* 2. Capstone_Selecting-Dataset: Included model performance on both unprocessed and processed datasets.
* 3. Capstone_Pre-Processing: Includes all preprocessing done.
* 4. Capstone_SVC: Includes the basic model, intermediate parameter tuning steps leding to the final optimized model.
* 5. Capstone_LR: Includes the basic model, intermediate parameter tuning steps leding to the final optimized model.
* 6. Capstone_LGBM: Includes the basic model, intermediate parameter tuning steps leding to the final optimized model.
* 7. Capstone_Keras: Includes the basic model, intermediate parameter tuning steps leding to the final optimized model.
