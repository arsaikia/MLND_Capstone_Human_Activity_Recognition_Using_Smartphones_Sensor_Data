# To find an Optimum Machine Learning Model for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Sensor Data

This repository describes an approach to determine Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Sensor Data.

The solution uses Python 2.7, but can also be used with python 3.x

Python packages Required to run the Notebooks: 
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Keras
* Tensorflow
* pickle
* LightGBM

## Required Files
  Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/ human-activity-recognition-with-smartphones/data
  
  
## Steps

* Run the notebooks based on their numeric sequencing after downloading the dataset.
* The report includes explaination for each implementation with embeded links clicking on which will lead to the Implementation/Jupyter Notebook.
